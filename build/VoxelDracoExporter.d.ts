 * Export draco compressed files from threejs geometry objects.
 *
 * Draco files are compressed and usually are smaller than conventional 3D file formats.
 *
 * The exporter receives a options object containing
 *  - decodeSpeed, indicates how to tune the encoder regarding decode speed (0 gives better speed but worst quality)
 *  - encodeSpeed, indicates how to tune the encoder parameters (0 gives better speed but worst quality)
 *  - encoderMethod
 *  - quantization, indicates the presision of each type of data stored in the draco file in the order (POSITION, NORMAL, COLOR, TEX_COORD, GENERIC)
 *  - exportUvs
 *  - exportNormals
